		<p> I love cats.  </p>
		<p> I currently have a cat named Lunar. She is a cute little black and orange domestic shorthair cat. Lunar loves to play and require a lot of attention. She has had multiple owners throughout the years and has been abused many times by many different people.
		Lunar has no hair on her arms, legs, and stomach because of
		being abused. When the hair grows back in, she rips it out again. We dont know why she tears our her hair but its probably due to seperation anxiety. She is afraid she will be put up for adoption again so she gets stressed and eats her own hair. She probably needs another cat at home. I also had a cat when I was younger named Chloe. Chloe died at 14 years old. Chloe was a fluffy black and white cat that loved playing and sleeping. </p>
